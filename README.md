# rlox

**rlox** is a Rust implementation of the
[Lox](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) programming language interpreter.

This is my personal implementation, created without referencing other existing
versions. The code is a work in progress and may be rough in places, as I’m
using this project to improve my Rust skills.

I’ll continue updating it as I progress through the book.
